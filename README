There are two instances of my code in this directory.

If I am allowed to use the SciKit-Learn package, then please look at comparePoems.py
If I am NOT allowed to use the SciKit-Learn package, then please run
comparePoemsWithoutSciKit.py in the same way. 

This code may be run as follows:

Usage: comparePoems.py reference_poems_dir query_poem num_most_similar
for example by running:
python comparePoems.py poem-corpus/ poem-corpus/67 9
you would be finding the 9 most common files in poem-corpus to the file poem-corpus/67


This code takes three arguments:
reference_poems_dir: this references the directory that contains all the
reference poems. It may not contain any other documents, as it is assumed that
all documents in this directory are for analysis (note, if you navigate to this
directory in a mac, it may make a .DSStore document that will throw an error)

query_poem: this is the path to the poem you want to query. this can be in the
reference_poems_dir, but can be any other poem you like on your machine

num_most_similar: this tells the software how many reference poems to return.
It will always return these poems in order of most similar to least similar
